            <h1>Health and Fitness</h1>
            <p>We train athletes â€“ professional, collegiate, youth, and anybody that wants to train like an athlete. When we speak of training we are talking about speed, strength, power, and sports therapy.
            </p>
            <p>Our business is aimed at a health conscience adult who wants to move beyond the usual local gym.
            </p>
            <h2>We are open 24:7</h2>
            <p> You can now train any time you like, weekdays, weekends & public holidays. WE ARE OPEN!Unlike other so called 24:7 gyms, we are staffed all the time.
            </p>
            <p>If you need a late night workout, a protein bar or shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we are open for you. Our class times change constantly so check out on the web site for the timetable at each of our clubs.
