    <!-- ABOUT US -->
    <div class="contentpage">
        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at Ashgrove, 
            Brisbane City, Chermside, Graceville and Westlake.
        </p>
        <p>
            ML Strength is Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, 
            with gyms opening throughout the Brisbane metropolitan area.
             ML Strength believes fitness comes first and keeping fit and
            improving your health is not just a fad - it's a way of life.
            Whether your goal is weight loss, body building, nutrition 
            or diet improvements, having more energy, or just looking 
            and feeling better - we're here for you! 
        </p>
        <p>
            ML Strength can offer cutting edge exercise options, including
             group fitness classes and one-on-one personal training 
             sessions for weight loss, circuit training, boxing and
            karate. Our trainers are all Les Mills accredited 
            instructors and are second to none – all have Bachelor
            Degrees in Human Movements.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are a family operated business that has little to do
             with the rest of the fitness industry. Our gym world
            does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership 
            consultants. Our gyms speak for themselves, our members do
            our marketing. We believe that word of mouth has way more 
            credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams
            up.  You are always welcome to look through any of our
            gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever.
            With hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants 
            hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on
            being a refreshing change from that. Our 'no 
            obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly evident
            with our $10 CASUAL visit rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share 
            that passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms
            have an old school feel with a new school attitude!
